# DSA_AMAZON-PRODUCT-REVIEW-ANALYSIS
This project explores product and customer review data to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement within a Fictional e-commerce company, RetailTech Insights, using Microsoft Excel Pivot Tables and charts. 
## Project Topic
Amazon Product Review Analysis
## Introduction
### Company Overview 
You are working as a Junior Data Analyst at RetailTech Insights, a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon. Your team has been tasked with analyzing product and customer review data to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.
## Project Description
This project explores product and customer review data to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement within a Fictional e-commerce company, RetailTech Insights, using Microsoft Excel Pivot Tables and charts. The analysis was conducted as part of a training program by Digital Skillup Africa (DSA) 
## Problem Statement
### Analysis Tasks; 
Use pivot tables and calculated columns where necessary to answer the following:
 1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
 2. How many products are listed under each category? 
3. What is the total number of reviews per category? 
4. Which products have the highest average ratings? 
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category? 
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
 7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more? 
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)? 
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category? 
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., ₹500)?
 11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount? 
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews? 
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts? 
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined. 
#### Final Task:
##### Dashboard Creation

Using your cleaned dataset and pivot outputs, build an Excel dashboard. Unleash your Creativity
## Dataset Description
The dataset was given by the DSA Team.
The dataset contains information scraped from Amazon product pages; it contains:

 • Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings • Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content • Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values Total Records: 1,465 Total Fields: 16 columns. 





















 
 ## Skills/ Concepts Demonstrated
 I looked into the data set and the data cleaning process was completed,
 
- Removing Duplicates

 - Handling Missing Values

 - Standardizing Formats

- Cleaning Text Data

- Data Validation

- Autofill

- Conditional Formatting

#### Analysis task

- Pivot tables creation

- sorting and filtering

- Statistical Functions

- Conditional Formatting

- Charts

- Analyze Data

I was able to perform text cleaning on the issues of long names of products and category names of the name and category of product columns. I splinted the name and category column into separate columns based on delimiters. I used functions like UPPER, LOWER, PROPER, and TRIM to standardize the text cases and remove extra spaces.  I also ensured numbers are in the correct format using “Format cells”.
 Organized and prepared the dataset for analysis and decision making.
I analyzed the cleaned dataset summarizing and analyze the large datasets by creating pivot tables, to provide answers to the problems statement individually. I also utilize Excel's built-in statistical functions (e.g., AVERAGE, SUMIF, COUNTIF) to perform calculations and gain insights. 
Used Excel's "Analyze Data" feature (Home tab > Analyze Data) to automatically generate insights, charts, and pivot tables based on the dataset and problem statements.
 Performed filter on the data based on product category and product names to focus on relevant insights.
I Created various chart types (bar, line, pie, etc.) to visualize data patterns and relationships. 
Utilized text functions (e.g., TRIM, CONCATENATE) to manipulate and analyzed the text dataset. 
#### Dashboard Creation:
I created a separate sheet for my dashboard and designed its layout, incorporating charts and visualizations that effectively represent the dataset and asked questions. Finally, I linked my created charts and data to the source data and customize the dashboard's appearance.
Considered Slicers to filter data and make the dashboard interactive.
## Conclusions     [My Excel DSA Project.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21104942/My.Excel.DSA.Project.xlsx)
#### Product Improvement:
Based on the customer reviews, customers needs are centered on product quality, discounts and speed of deliverings.
#### Marketing Strategies:
Optimizing website and content for search engines to improve visibility and attract traffic.  Adding new functionalities or upgrading existing ones can enhance the value proposition and attract a wider user base. 
#### Customer Engagement:
Creating a personalized experience for each customer, demonstrating that their individual needs are valued. 
Paying close attention to customer reviews, both positive and negative, and using it to improve products and services. 
## Recommendations 
Given the potentiality of profit, Amazon should focus on customer reviews to refine product quality, improve customer experience in speedy deliveries and stay up-to-date with latest trends.
